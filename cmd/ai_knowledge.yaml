  key_business_processes:
    - AI prompting: Provides prompts to an AI client for generating responses.
    - Knowledge base update: Gathers information and updates a YAML knowledge base.
    - Pull request review: Automates the review process of GitHub pull requests using AI.
    - README creation: Generates a README file summarizing the directory's key information.
  modules:
    - Helpers
    - Knowledge Base
    - Pull Request Review
    - README Generator
    - Root Command
    - Version Command
  architectural_patterns:
    - Command line utility with `cobra` library.
    - Concurrent processing using `sync.WaitGroup`.
    - Contextual logging with `context` and `log/slog`.
    - Configuration management using `viper`.
    - File operations for logging and writing outputs.
    - External API interactions with `aihelpers` and `github`.
  key_files:
    - helpers.go: Provides utility functions for AI prompt and logging operations.
    - knowledgebase.go: Handles updating the AI knowledge base.
    - pr.go: Manages pull request reviews with AI assistance.
    - readme.go: Generates README files with AI-generated summaries.
    - root.go: Sets up the main `neurospecation` command interface.
    - version.go: Outputs the current version details of the software.
  key_links_to_other_modules:
    - aihelpers: A package dependency used for AI-related functions.
    - dirhelper: A package used for navigating directories.
    - github: Go module for interacting with GitHub.
  key_external_dependencies:
    - Cobra: For command line utilities.
    - Viper: For configuration management.
    - slog: For structured logging.

  noteworthy_information:
    - Dry-run mode (controlled via flag) to test without making external changes.
    - Supports environmental variables for sensitive information (API keys, GitHub credentials).
    - Implements rate-limiting for API requests to prevent overload.
