software_directory:
  name: cmd/neurospecation
  description: This directory primarily contains the code for creating AI-based operations such as updating a knowledge base, creating a README file, and reviewing pull requests.

key_business_processes:
  - Update the knowledge base of AI with current directory information.
  - Generate concise README files for directories using AI.
  - Review pull requests by analyzing code differences and providing feedback.

module_explanation:
  module_name: Neurospecation
  purpose: Provides an interface for AI-based directory analyses which includes generating documentation and reviewing code changes.
  features:
    - Utilize AI models to generate informative documentation and perform code reviews.
    - Model selection and logging preferences through command-line flags.

architectural_patterns:
  type: Command Line Interface (CLI)
  description: The software uses a CLI pattern to allow users to run different operations (knowledge update, README creation, PR review) through command-line flags. Each command interacts with AI to perform the required tasks.
  
key_files:
  - main.go: The main entry point for the directory. It initializes flags, configurations, and executes the primary functionality (AI-based operations).

key_links_to_other_modules:
  - aihelpers: Interfaces with AI models to execute tasks like generating documentation and code reviews.
  - dirhelper: Manages directory traversal and file content extraction.

additional_information:
  versioning:
    version: dev
    commit: none
    date: unknown
  dependencies:
    - OpenAI API: Utilized for interacting with AI models, governed by the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
  execution:
    - Command-line flags control the different features enabled, such as `-dr` for dry-run mode, `-uk` to update the knowledge base, etc.
