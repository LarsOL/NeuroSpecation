business_processes:
  - Provides a client interface to interact with OpenAI's API for sending prompts and receiving responses.
  - Supports customization of the AI model used for processing requests.

module_overview:
  - The 'aihelpers' directory contains functionality for initializing and managing a client that interacts with OpenAI's services, particularly for handling text prompts and obtaining AI-generated responses.

architectural_patterns:
  - Uses an object-oriented approach with a focus on encapsulation through the AIClient structure to manage interactions with the OpenAI API.
  - Adheres to a modular design to isolate OpenAI client operations.

key_files:
  - aihelpers.go: Contains all definitions and implementations for initializing and using the AI client, handling prompt requests, and managing configuration such as API keys and models.

inter_module_relationships:
  - Depends on the `github.com/openai/openai-go` package to interface with OpenAI's API.
  - Utilizes the contextual capabilities of the Go `context` package for managing request lifecycles.

additional_insights:
  - A `TODO` is present to convert the current implementation to a streaming version to mitigate high memory usage when processing large payloads.
  - Error handling is included to ensure API key and model configurations are set, and wraps errors with additional context for better traceability in failure scenarios.
  - Future expansions could focus on optimizing performance by improving request handling, such as customizing the parameters used for OpenAI requests.
