  description: A package to interact with OpenAI's API using a client.
  business_processes:
    - Interfacing with OpenAI's API for prompt-based text generation.
  module:
    name: aihelpers
    language: Go
  architectural_patterns:
    - Client-Server: The AIClient acts as a client to communicate with the OpenAI API server.
  key_files:
    - aihelpers.go: Contains the main logic for interacting with the OpenAI API.
  key_components:
    - AIClient:
        description: Data structure representing an OpenAI client.
        fields:
          - APIKey: string, used for authentication with OpenAI.
          - Model: string, specifies the AI model for requests.
          - Client: *openai.Client, OpenAI client instance for API interaction.
    - NewOpenAIClient:
        description: Function to initialize a new AIClient with API key and model.
    - SetModel:
        description: Method to set the AI model to use for requests.
    - PromptRequest:
        description: Structure to encapsulate the parameters for making a prompt request.
        fields:
          - Prompt: string, user input to send to OpenAI.
          - MaxTokens: int, optional maximum number of tokens for the response.
          - Temperature: float64, optional, affects the randomness of the response.
    - Prompt:
        description: Method to send a prompt to OpenAI and receive a response.
  identified_issues:
    - Enhancements:
      - Convert the `Prompt` function to a streaming version to handle large data without high memory usage.
    - TODO: Use `PromptRequest` struct more effectively to tailor API requests.
  dependencies:
    - openai-go: A library client for OpenAI's API.
  context_links:
    - Relies on openai-go library for OpenAI API interactions.
