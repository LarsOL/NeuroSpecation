description: >
  The aihelpers directory contains a single Go source file which provides functionalities
  to interface with OpenAI APIs. This includes client initialization and prompt request handling.
key_business_processes:
  - Initialize an OpenAI client
  - Set the AI model for requests
  - Send prompt requests to OpenAI and handle responses
module_explanation: >
  This module acts as a helper to communicate with OpenAI's services using Go. It facilitates sending requests
  to OpenAI's chat completion service and receiving the response, ensuring proper API key and model configurations.
architectural_patterns:
  - Client initialization pattern
  - Singleton-like structure for AI client to ensure consistent configuration
  - Error handling for network-related operations
key_files:
  - aihelpers.go: The main source file containing all functionalities related to OpenAI client operations.
key_links_to_other_modules:
  - Dependency on the OpenAI Go SDK for API client creation and chat services usage.
  - Usage of 'github.com/openai/openai-go' package to facilitate API interactions.

additional_information:
  - There is a TODO note about converting the request handling to a streaming version for better memory management.
