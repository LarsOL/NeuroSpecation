business_processes:
  - Traversing and processing directory trees.
  - Filtering and handling files with specific extensions in directories.
  - Performing custom actions on directory contents through callback functions.

module_overview:
  - The "dirhelper" module provides utilities for traversing and processing directory structures in a file system.
  - It is responsible for reading directory contents, filtering entries based on certain criteria, and executing user-defined actions on these entries.

architectural_patterns:
  - The module uses the Strategy Pattern for filtering directory nodes by allowing the injection of custom filter functions.
  - It employs the Callback Pattern by accepting a function to execute on directories as part of its traversal mechanism.

key_files:
  - dirhelper.go: Contains all functionality for directory traversal, file filtering, and custom directory processing via callbacks. It defines key types and functions such as `FileContent`, `WalkDirectories`, and `FilterNodes`.

inter_module_relationships:
  - There are no explicit interactions or dependencies with other modules in the provided code. The functionality seems standalone, aimed at general file system operations.

additional_insights:
  - The module reads file contents into memory, which might be a limitation for handling very large files or large numbers of files.
  - It includes default and customizable filtering mechanisms that enable flexibility in directory traversal operations.
  - No explicit security measures or concerns are articulated in the provided code snippet; considerations might include validating inputs for directory paths or handling sensitive file content.
