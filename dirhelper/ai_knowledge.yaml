directory_info:
  name: dirhelper
  description: A utility package for traversing directories and processing files
  business_processes:
    - Traverse and process directories
    - Filter files and directories based on certain criteria
    - Perform custom actions on directories
  module_explanation: 
    - This module handles directory traversal and file filtering for applications that need to interact with file systems.
  architectural_patterns:
    - Utilizes callback functions for flexible directory processing (functional programming pattern)
    - Separation of concerns by defining clear functions for different operations
  key_files:
    - dirhelper.go: The main implementation file containing all the logic related to directory operations
  key_functions:
    - WalkDirectories: Core function for directory traversal and processing using customizable callbacks
    - readDirectoryContents: Reads files and subdirectory information from a given directory
    - IsCodeFile: Helper function to determine if a file is considered a code file based on its extension
    - FilterNodes: Function to filter out unwanted files and directories
  integration_links:
    - No direct links to other modules are specified in the provided information

additional_notes:
  - Focuses on code file processing, showing importance in coding environments handling various programming languages
  - Provides flexibility with filtering and callback functions allowing tailored directory processing tasks
  - Filter logic supports ignoring specific development and environment folders or files like '.git', '.idea', etc.
