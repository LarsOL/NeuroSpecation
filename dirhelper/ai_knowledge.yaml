directory: dirhelper
description: >
  The `dirhelper` directory contains functionality for traversing directories
  to filter and process files and subdirectories based on custom criteria, specifically
  for the identification of code files.

key_business_processes:
  - Directory traversal and processing.
  - Filtering files based on extensions and directory names.
  - Reading file contents and returning structured data.

module:
  name: dirhelper
  purpose: >
    To facilitate the traversal of directory structures, applying filters to determine
    which files and directories should be processed, and collating information about
    these files and directories.

architectural_patterns:
  - Walk function: Utilizes recursion to traverse directory paths.
  - Modular design: Uses function types (`FilterFunc`) for customizable filtering logic.

key_files:
  - dirhelper.go: Contains all the logic for directory traversal, filtering, and file content reading.

key_functions:
  - IsCodeFile(node fs.DirEntry): Determines if a directory entry is a code file based on extension.
  - FilterNodes(node fs.DirEntry): Filters out non-code files and specific unwanted directories.
  - WalkDirectories(root string, onDir func, filterNodes FilterFunc): Main traversal logic for processing directories.
  - readDirectoryContents(dir string, filterNodes FilterFunc): Helper function to read and categorize directory entries.

key_links_to_other_modules: none

additional_information:
  - Utilizes the Go standard libraries for filesystem operations.
  - Allows customization through the `FilterFunc` type for different directory filtering needs.
